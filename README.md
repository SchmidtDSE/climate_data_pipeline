### DevContainer

You will need the following:

  -  `Docker` (cli, but optionally the desktop app)
  -  `VSCode`, and the `Dev Containers` extension

To open the dev container, you can either:

#### Local

    1) Clone the repository and open the folder in VSCode
    2) Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`

#### Codespace

    1) Navigate to the repo on ![GitHub](https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/climate_data_pipeline)
    2) Click on the `Code` button and select `Open with Codespaces`
